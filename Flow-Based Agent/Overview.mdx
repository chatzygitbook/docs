Flow-based agents (Rule-based AI Agents) let you build chatbot interactions using a no-code, visual builder. These bots follow a strict logic where responses and flows are manually configured step by step.

- Operate on predefined rules and logic.
- Follow fixed paths (flows) set up with nodes and cards.
- **Smart AI Mode** can be used to handle unexpected inputs by integrating conversational AI.
