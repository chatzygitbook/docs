## **WhatsApp Message Template Setup**

What you'll need:
* An installed WhatsApp channel
* WhatsApp approved message template setup

***

### 1. Before You Begin

Make sure your WhatsApp number is connected to Chatzy AI. Go to **Channels** -> **WhatsApp** and check if it's visible.

> 🚀 *If it's not connected yet, please refer to the previous tutorial video on connecting WhatsApp.*

***

### 2. Accessing Message Templates

* Go to the **Message Templates** section in Chatzy AI.
* Select your **WhatsApp channel**.
* Here, you'll see all your existing templates (or an empty list if none exist).
* Click "**Create Template**" to get started.

***

### 3. Select a Template Category

Choose one of the following categories for your message:

* **Authentication**: For OTPs and login messages.
* **Utility**: For order updates, account info, or confirmations.
* **Marketing**: For promotions, offers, and brand awareness.

> 💡 *Marketing templates are most common but cost more. Make sure your category aligns with your message, or Meta may reject it.*

***

### 4. Template Basics

* **Template Name:** Use a unique and recognizable name.
* **Language:** Select the language for your template content.

***

### 5. Add Header (Optional)

You can add:
* **Media:** Image, video, or document (for preview only)
* **Text:** Bold text shown at the top

Select the type from the **Header Type** dropdown and upload the sample file or write header text.

> ⚠️ *Media added here is just a sample. You'll need to re-upload it when using this template in campaigns.*

***

### 6. Write the Message Body

This is the core content of your template. In the **Body** field:
* Type your message
* Use emojis, bold, or italic text to enhance readability
* Preview updates live

> 💬 *Keep it short, personalized, and actionable for better engagement.*

***

### 7. Add Footer (Optional)

Use the footer for:
* Sign-offs
* Greetings
* Minor notes

***

### 8. Add Interactive Buttons

Make your message actionable by adding:

* **Quick Reply**
    Users tap a button to send a predefined response.

* **Call to Action (CTA)**
    Users can:
    * Visit a website (URL)
    * Make a phone call

Add the appropriate URL or phone number as needed.

***

### 9. Use Variables for Personalization

Variables allow you to insert dynamic content like names or order IDs.

**How to add:**

* Click "**Add Variable**" below the Body field
    OR
* Manually type `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, etc. inside your message

Then, provide *sample values* for each variable (e.g., *John* , *@12345* ). These help Meta understand your template and speed up approval.

> 📝 *Real values are filled dynamically during campaigns or journeys.*

***

### 10. Final Steps & Meta Approval

* Review everything in the **preview pane**
* Click "**Create**"
* Your template will be sent to Meta for review (usually approved within seconds)
