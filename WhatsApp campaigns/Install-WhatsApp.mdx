### PART 2

### Installation criteria and rules

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="WhatsApp Number Requirements">
When installing WhatsApp, you will need to use a valid phone number, which you must have access to during the installation process.

The following rules apply:

- **Number ownership:** You must own the phone number that you want to use for WhatsApp Business API. This means that you must have legal control over the number, either by owning it or by having the authorization to use it for business purposes.
- **Number format:** The phone number that you register must follow the international format, which includes a country code and an area code. For example, if the phone number is from the United States and has the area code "408" and the number "555-1212", the full number would be "+1-408-555-1212".
- **Number availability:** If you are using a number from another provider or the number does not appear in the BSP provided numbers list, you must be able to receive calls or SMS messages. WhatsApp will send a verification code to the number as part of the activation process.
- **Number cleanliness:** The phone number must be "clean", which means that it hasn't been previously registered with WhatsApp by another user. If the phone has been used before, it might be associated with a different account, and WhatsApp won't be able to activate it for your business.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Accepted Number types">
You can use the following number type with WhatsApp:

- **Landline numbers:** These are fixed-line numbers that are typically associated with businesses.
- **Mobile numbers:** These are traditional mobile phone numbers that can receive SMS messages.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prohibited Number types">
The following number types are prohibited:

- **Numbers with an IVR** (automated call menu) attached to it, unless this feature can be disabled to receive the activation token.
- **Shortcodes**
- **Toll-free numbers**

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prohibited Business Verticals">
The following business verticals are not allowed by WhatsApp and will not be approved:

- Adult content
- Alcohol
- Animal sales, including live animals, livestock, or any parts of animals
- Currency
- Dating
- Defense
- Digital subscription and digital content
- Drugs or related products
- Gambling
- Tobacco
- Weapons, ammunition, explosiv

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WhatsApp Business account permissions">
To install WhatsApp, you need to grant Chatzy permission to access and manage your WhatsApp account.

You will share:

- Account access to allow Chatzy to create templates, add phone numbers, send messages, access metrics and assign users to your WhatsApp account.
- Billing management permissions. By default, a business is billed through Chatzy monthly invoice and we will pass on any charges that your WhatsApp business account incurs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WhatsApp Business display Name">
You must add a display name that you will use to message customers. The display name must meet [Facebook's Display Name Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/338047025165344).

If the display name represents a business that your company is working with (i.e., if the business is an agency, distributor, partner, or parent company), then the relationship between the business represented in the display name and end-client business must be evident and clear in both parties' business websites.

For example, if Global Voyager signs up for WhatsApp and wants to use the display name Commercial Air, you must submit links to both websites stating that Commercial Air is a subsidiary of Global Voyager.

If you check the box to say that your display name is different from their legal business name, you will then be prompted to enter a link to a website citing the business relationship.
