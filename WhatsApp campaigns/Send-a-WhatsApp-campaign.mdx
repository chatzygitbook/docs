Send engaging marketing messages to your customers on WhatsApp

### **What is a WhatsApp Campaign?**

A WhatsApp campaign is used to send the **same message to many contacts at once**—perfect for:

* Promotions
* Announcements
* Event reminders
* Bulk updates

***

### **Before You Begin**

Ensure you've already completed:

1. Connected your **WhatsApp channel**
2. Created an **approved WhatsApp template**
3. Created a **Contact List** with your target recipients

> These are essential prerequisites. If you haven't done these, refer to the respective tutorials first.

### **Step-by-Step: Sending a WhatsApp Campaign**

#### **1. Navigate to Campaigns**

* Go to the **left sidebar**
* Click "**Campaigns**"
* Here, you'll see a table of existing campaigns with:
    * Name
    * Trigger Date
    * Channel
    * Target List

***

#### **2. Create a New Campaign**

* Click "**Create Campaign**"
* Enter a **Campaign Name** that is easy to recognize later

***

#### **3. Set Channel and Recipients**

* **Select Channel:** WhatsApp
* **Recipient Type:** Choose "**List**"
* **Select List:** Pick a pre-created list containing your target audience

***

#### **4. Choose Message Type**

* **Message Type:** WhatsApp Template
* **Select Template:** Choose from your **approved WhatsApp templates**

***

#### **5. Fill in Template Parameters**

Your template may have placeholders (called **parameters**). These could be:

* **Text Parameters:**
    * Manually enter a value
    * Or use a **contact variable**, like:
        * `{{ contact.firstname }}`
    * Click the variable icon ( `[x]` ) to browse available options
* **Media Parameters (if any):**
    * Upload the required media (image, video, document)
    * Use the **Upload Resource** option

Example: Greet users by name using `{{ contact.firstname }}`
This will auto-populate the user's first name when sending the message.

***

#### **6. Test Your Campaign**

* Click "**Create and Test**"
* Use the **preview window** to review your message
* Select a contact (ideally yourself) to simulate delivery
* Click "**Send Test Message**" to verify the final message

***

#### **7. Launch Your Campaign**

After testing:

* Click "**Send Campaign**"
* Choose one of two options:
    * **Send Now** (immediately)
    * **Schedule for Later**

***

#### **8. Monitor Campaign Performance**

Once the campaign is live:

* Messages begin sending within a few minutes
* You can monitor:
    * Total contacts messaged
    * Delivery success
    * Read receipts
    * Failed attempts

> If any messages fail, it may be due to opt-out status, invalid numbers, or delivery issues—these will be covered in a separate troubleshooting guide.
