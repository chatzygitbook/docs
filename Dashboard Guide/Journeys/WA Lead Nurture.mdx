### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, make sure you've:
1. Connected your **WhatsApp account**
2. Created **WhatsApp message templates**
3. Created a **List** and **added contacts** to it

***

### Step-by-Step: Building the Journey

#### 1. Go to Journeys

* Open the left sidebar
* Click "**Journeys**"
* Click "**Create Journey**"
* Give your journey a name

> You'll see an option to use a template. A **WhatsApp Lead Nurture template** exists, but we'll build it from scratch so you fully understand the process.

Click "**Create**" to enter the Journey Studio.

***

### Understanding Journeys

A **Journey** is a sequence of steps starting with a **trigger**, followed by one or more **actions**.

These steps can be combined in various ways to create powerful **automations** across digital channels.

In this tutorial, we'll focus on **WhatsApp Lead Nurture**.

***

#### 2. Add a Trigger

Click "**Add Trigger**" and select:

* **Contact Added to List**

This means the journey will begin when a new contact is added to a specific list.

In the right panel:
* Select the **List** that will trigger the journey

> **Note:** If a contact is already on the list and added again, the journey **will not** trigger again for them.

* **Alternate Trigger (Advanced)**
You can also use the **Inbound Webhook** trigger to start journeys from:
* External platforms like Wix/WordPress
* CRMs when a lead is created

***

#### 3. Add First Message

Click the **plus (+) icon**
Select "**Send Message**"

In the right panel:
* Choose **WhatsApp** as the channel
* Use a **variable** for the phone number:
    * Click the variable icon
    * Select `contact.phoneNumber`
* Select an **approved WhatsApp template**

If your template includes parameters:
* For **text**, use variables like `{{ contact.firstname }}`
* For **media**, upload the file or paste a public URL

> **Example:** To greet users by name, use `{{ contact.firstname }}`
This automatically inserts each contact's name when the message is sent.

***

#### 4. Add Wait Step

Click the **plus (+) icon**
Select "**Wait**"

* Set a delay (e.g., `3 days`)
* Optionally, choose a **specific time** for the next message

This allows you to control the timing of follow-ups.

***

#### 5. Add Next Message

After the wait, add another "**Send Message**" step just like before:

* Choose WhatsApp
* Use phone number variable
* Select a different template
* Fill in the parameters

> Repeat this **Wait + Message** sequence as many times as needed for your lead nurturing flow.

***

#### 6. Publish the Journey

Once complete:
* Click "**Publish**" at the top right

Your journey is now **live** and ready to run.

***

#### 7. Test the Journey

To test:
1. Go to **Contacts**
2. Select a contact (ideally your own)
3. Add the contact to the **trigger list**

Return to **Journeys** and click on the journey name:
* Go to the "**Runs**" tab
* You'll see:
    * Status of each contact in the journey
    * Completed steps
    * Current step
    * Any failed actions

Click on a contact's name to see their **detailed journey progress**.
