These are built-in helper functions provided by the Chatzy Sandbox environment.  
They are ready to use without needing additional setup.

> We have an **inbuilt dictionary** in Chatzy named **`variables[]`** that stores all variables used in the environment.  
  You can use it to store, retrieve, or update variable values at any point in your Execute Code node.

> **Example:**  
> variables["user_name"] = "John"   # Store a value <br/>
> print(variables["user_name"])     # Access the value â†’ Outputs: John

---

> The `variables[]` dictionary is not required inside the **Transitions node**, as variables can be accessed directly.
