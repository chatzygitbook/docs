openapi: post /get_id_token
---

Authenticates a user with their email and password and returns a JWT `idToken`.

This `idToken` must be included in the `Authorization` header when calling **protected APIs**.

### üõ°Ô∏è Authorization Header Format:

```http
Authorization: <idToken>
```

Without a valid token, protected routes will respond with a 401 Unauthorized error. This token expires after **1 hour** after which you must call `/get_id_token` again to obtain a new one.
