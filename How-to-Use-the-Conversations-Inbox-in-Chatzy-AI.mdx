The **Conversations tab** —  **unified inbox** for handling all customer messages across **WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger**.

This is where your team and AI agents can **view, reply, and manage chats** from one central location.

***

### 🕒 Overview: What Is the Conversations Tab?

The Conversations tab allows you to:
* See **all incoming and past chats**
* Identify the channel (WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger)
* Respond using **human agents**, **AI bots**, or **flow automations**
* Access contact details and conversation history

***

### 🤳 Navigating the Conversations Tab

Once inside:
* You'll see a **list of contacts** on the left
* Each row includes:
    * **Contact name** (if saved)
    * **Channel icon** (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram)
    * **Activity indicators** (e.g., green dots, blue checkmarks)

Click a contact to:
* View the **chat history** on the right
* Open their **contact card** (far right panel)
* See attributes, tags, creation date, and more

***

### 🕒 Conversation Sorting & Status

* Chats are **auto-sorted** by most recent activity
* **Unread messages** show a **blue checkmark**
    * Clicking them marks them as **read**
* Use the "**Unread**" filter to focus only on unanswered chats

***

### 🟢 What Does the Green Dot Mean?

A **green dot** = the conversation is **live**, and one of the following is handling it:
1. **Conversational AI Agent** – auto-replies using AI
2. **Flow-based AI Agent** – auto-replies based on predefined flows
3. **Human Agent** – a team member assigned manually

You can **take control** of a conversation by clicking "**Close Conversation**" to stop AI responses and reply manually.

### 📱 WhatsApp-Specific Rules

#### ✅ Inside the 24-Hour Window
If the customer messaged you **within the last 24 hours**:
* You can reply with **text**, **media**, or **templates**

#### 🚫 Outside the 24-Hour Window
If it's been **over 24 hours** since the contact's last message:
* WhatsApp **limits replies to template messages only**
* You'll see a "**Send Template**" button instead of the usual input box
* Once the template is sent, the conversation becomes **active** again

***

### 📂 Sending & Receiving Media

* You can send **images, PDFs, and files**
* If a user sends media, click to preview or **right-click → Save** to download

***

### 📬 Messenger & Instagram Notes

* No 24-hour restrictions
* You can message any contact at **any time**
* Great for follow-ups, support, and lead nurturing

***

### 🔄 Managing Agent and AI Interactions

* When a conversation is assigned to a **human agent**:
    * **AI bots and campaigns are disabled** for that contact
* When it's assigned to **AI or a flow**:
    * Human agents and campaigns are **paused** to prevent confusion
* To **reassign to AI or reopen to campaigns**, click "**Close Conversation**"

***

### 🧑‍💻 Managing Access with Agent Roles

* Team members with the "**Agent**" role can:
    * Access the Conversations tab
    * Reply directly to customer chats
* You can invite team members and assign this role from the **Team Settings** page
