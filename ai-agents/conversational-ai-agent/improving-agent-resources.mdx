Enhancing your agent's resources ensures better performance, higher
accuracy, and smoother user experiences. Here are a few best practices:

## Best Practices

-   **Provide Clean, Structured Data**\
    Well-formatted and organized data helps your agent retrieve accurate
    answers quickly. Avoid uploading noisy or redundant information.

-   **Use Diverse Knowledge Sources**\
    Combine different formats---FAQs, guides, manuals, and product
    catalogs---to give your agent richer context.

-   **Update Content Regularly**\
    Keep your resources up-to-date with the latest information,
    policies, and product details to avoid outdated responses.

-   **Optimize Chunk Sizes**\
    Adjust data chunking in settings for a balance between precision
    (small chunks) and context retention (larger chunks).



-   **Prioritize Frequently Asked Questions**\
    Upload FAQs as a separate, easily retrievable source to speed up
    common queries.

-   **Test and Refine Regularly**\
    Monitor responses, identify gaps, and fine-tune your resources to
    continuously improve accuracy.
