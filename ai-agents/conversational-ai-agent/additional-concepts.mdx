### Chunking

Chunking is the process of splitting large documents or datasets into smaller, manageable pieces called *chunks*.  

- **Why it matters**: AI models can only process a limited number of tokens at once. By chunking data, the system ensures that long documents are searchable and retrievable.  

- **Best practices**:  
  - **Smaller chunks** → Higher precision (AI focuses better), but risk losing broader context.  
  - **Larger chunks** → Preserve context, but retrieval may include extra, less relevant information.  
  - The right balance depends on your use cases.

### How RAG Works in a Chatbot

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances chatbot responses by combining two steps:  

1. **Retrieve** → The system searches through your *chunked knowledge base* using methods like:  
   - **Semantic search**: Finds results based on meaning, not just keywords.  
   - **Hybrid search**: Combines semantic and keyword matching for better accuracy.  

2. **Generate** → The retrieved chunks are passed as *context* to the AI model, which then crafts the final answer.

### Benefits of RAG  
- Prevents the chatbot from “hallucinating” answers.  
- Grounds responses in your actual uploaded data.  
- Efficiently handles large knowledge bases by retrieving only the most relevant chunks.

⚡ **In short**:  
- *Chunking* makes your data searchable.  
- *RAG* ensures the chatbot pulls the most relevant pieces and uses them to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
