The **Advanced Settings** tab gives you detailed control over how your chatbot processes information. These options affect how data is retrieved, how conversations are remembered, and how responses are generated.

### Key Features

- **Adjust Chunks**  
  Control how your uploaded data is split into smaller units (*chunks*) for the AI to process.  
  - **Chunks**: Number of segments your data is divided into (e.g., 5).  
  - **Chunk Length**: Size of each chunk.  
  - **Tip**: Smaller chunks improve precision but may lose context, while larger chunks preserve more information but can be less focused.

- **Hybrid Search**  
  Enhances retrieval accuracy by combining two methods:  
  - **Keyword Search**: Matches exact words or phrases.  
  - **Semantic Search**: Understands meaning and intent.  
  This dual approach ensures better results for conversational or complex queries.

- **Add Historical Context**  
  Enables the chatbot to reference earlier parts of the conversation (both user and AI messages).  
  This improves continuity and relevance but uses additional credits per message.

- **Max Tokens**  
  Sets the maximum length of a response (measured in tokens  words or word parts).  
  Helps manage cost, control verbosity, and ensure the bot responds within limits.

- **Token Distribution**  
  Visual slider that shows how your total `Max Tokens` are allocated across different components:  
  - **Base Prompt + Function Call + Media**  
  - **Context (Knowledge)**  
  - **Chat History**  
  - **Response + Reasoning**  

  Example allocation:  
  - Base Prompt + Function Call + Media → ~1,500 tokens  
  - Context (Knowledge) → ~7,500 tokens  
  - Chat History → ~5,000 tokens  
  - Response + Reasoning → ~1,000 tokens  

  > You can dynamically adjust these allocations to balance accuracy, context retention, and reasoning depth.
