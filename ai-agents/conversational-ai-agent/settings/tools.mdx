The **Tools** tab extends your chatbot’s capabilities with built-in functions and integrations. These tools allow your bot to move beyond simple Q&A and perform specific actions within conversations.

### Available Tools

- **Journey**  
  Trigger a pre-designed sequence of actions (called a *journey*) for your chatbot to follow.  
  A journey could be:  
  - Lead qualification process  
  - Customer onboarding   
  - Support escalation flow  

- **WhatsApp Tools**  
  These are specialized functions for bots integrated with **WhatsApp**:  
  - **Close Conversation** → Formally end a WhatsApp chat, ensuring a clean exit for both user and bot.  
  - **Get Details** → Automatically fetch user information from the chat (e.g., phone number, profile name).  

- **Additional Settings**  
  - **Get Contact Details** → Collect user information such as name, email, or phone number directly during the conversation.  
    This is especially useful for **lead generation** or **customer service workflows**.
