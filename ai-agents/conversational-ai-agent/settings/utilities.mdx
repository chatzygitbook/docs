### Key Features

- **Include Date & Time Context**  
  Grants the chatbot access to the current date and time. Useful for real-time queries like:  
  - *“Book my appointment for Tomorrow”*  
  - *“What time is it now?”*  

- **Include Messages Timestamp**  
  Adds a timestamp to each stored message in the conversation history. This helps the AI understand and respond to references such as:  
  - *“What did I ask you five minutes ago?”*  
  - *“Remind me what we discussed yesterday.”*  

- **Convert Leads to Contacts**  
  Automates the sales funnel by upgrading a **lead** (new prospect) to a **contact** (qualified prospect) in your system.  
  - Streamlines customer relationship management  
  - Saves manual effort in lead handling  
  - **Note:** Requires **Lead Notifications** to be configured and enabled in your dashboard.
