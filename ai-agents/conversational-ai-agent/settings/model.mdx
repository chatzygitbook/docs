- **Creative (>0):** More varied and imaginative responses. Ideal for brainstorming, creative writing, or casual conversations.  

#### Available Models
Each model offers unique strengths for different use cases:  
- **GPT-4o 128K** – Advanced, versatile model for complex and demanding tasks.  
- **GPT-4o-Mini 128K** – Lightweight, fast, and cost-effective for simpler tasks.  
- **Claude Sonnet 4 200K** – Balanced model with strong reasoning for multi-step problem solving.  
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku 200K** – Extremely fast and affordable, best for high-volume and lightweight tasks.  
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash 1M** – Efficient blend of reasoning and speed, adaptable to a wide range of tasks.  

#### Custom Reasoning
With **Custom Reasoning**, the AI can process complex, multi-step problems more effectively.  
- Available only for: **Claude Sonnet 4 200K** and **Gemini 2.5 Flash 1M**.  

**Select Max Reasoning Tokens** <br/>
When **Custom Reasoning** is enabled, you can adjust the **Max Reasoning Tokens** setting.  
- This determines the AI’s "thinking budget" before generating a response.  
- **Higher token count:** Better quality answers for complex queries (but may increase latency).  
- **Lower token count:** Faster responses, suitable for straightforward tasks.
