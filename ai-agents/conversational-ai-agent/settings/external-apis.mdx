The **External APIs** tab lets you extend your chatbot’s abilities by connecting it to external services. With these integrations, your bot can go beyond its built-in knowledge fetching real-time data, sending information, or interacting with your applications.

### Key Settings
- **API Name**  
  A simple label to identify the API connection.

- **Endpoint**  
  The specific URL (web address) the chatbot will send requests to.

- **Description**  
  A short explanation of what the API does, and the use cases when should chatbot send request.

- **Method**  
  Defines how the chatbot communicates with the API:  
  - **GET** → Retrieve information from an external service.  
  - **POST** → Send information to an external service.  

- **Auth Token**  
  A secure key that verifies your chatbot’s access rights to the API.  
  Ensures only authorized requests are processed.


- **Variables (Query Parameters)**  
  This section lets you create dynamic inputs for your API calls.  
  Variables are added as **Query Parameters** (key-value pairs) at the end of the endpoint URL.  

  Each variable includes:  
  - **Name** → Identifier for the variable (e.g., `city`).  
  - **Type** → Data type of the value (e.g., `string`).  
  - **Description** → Short explanation of the variable’s role.  
  - **Example** → Sample value showing how it works in practice.  

  **Example:**  
  If you define a variable with:  
  - Name: `city`  
  - Value: `Pune`  

  The API call will look like:  
  ```https://api.example.com/weather?city=Pune```

> To call your API, you need to include it as an instruction in the prompt with usecase.  
> Example: *Use the `get_weather_by_city` function to fetch weather data.*
