### What It Flow-Based Agent
A deterministic, guided-flow agent that moves users through predefined steps using buttons, menus, and validations. Ideal when you want total control over the experience.

### Best For
- Lead capture and qualification
- Appointment/leave requests
- Onboarding checklists
- Event registrations
- Feedback collection with fixed fields

### Key Strengths
- **Predictable & Controllable:** Every step, field, and branch is explicit.
- **Low Risk:** Minimal chance of off-topic answers; easy to QA.
- **Fast to Ship:** No training data required; publish as soon as flows are built.
- **High Completion Rates:** Clear, linear steps reduce drop-offs.

### Limitations
- **Rigid for Open-Ended Queries:** Struggles with unstructured, typed questions.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** New paths must be added manually.
- **Lower “Human-like” Feel:** Conversational nuance is limited.

### Setup Notes in ChatzyAI

- Add field validations and error prompts.
- Use webhook triggers/integrations for CRM or form submissions.
- Provide a fallback: human handoff or a short FAQ shortcut.
