## Types of AI agents in ChatzyAI

Currently we offer two types of the AI agents 
- Flow-Based AI agent <br/>
    These agents follow predefined flows and structured paths to guide users step by step. They are highly reliable for **predictable, repetitive, and form-based tasks** such as lead capture, appointment booking, or event registration. Flow-Based AI Agents ensure **accuracy, control, and consistency**, making them ideal when the process must remain structured.

- Conversational AI agent <br/>
    These agents use natural language understanding to engage in **open-ended, human-like conversations**. They can handle varied questions, adapt to context, and personalize responses based on past interactions. Conversational AI Agents are best suited for **customer support, sales queries, and knowledge-based interactions**, where flexibility and adaptability are key.
