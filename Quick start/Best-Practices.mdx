# Best Practices

## 1. 🧠 Write Clear Instructions

Give your bot a solid behavioral foundation. Instructions help define tone, personality, and limitations.

**Example Instruction:**

> "You are a helpful support agent for a clothing store. Only respond to queries related to products, orders, or returns. Be friendly and concise."

---

## 2. 📄 Use Clear, Readable Data

Your AI agent learns from the content you provide. To ensure good performance:

- Use clean and structured PDFs or website links.
- Avoid ambiguous, vague, or outdated information.
- Prefer bullet points and concise paragraphs.

✅ **Good:**

> - Product: SmartWatch Z2
> - Price: ₹3,999
> - Delivery: Within 3–5 business days
> - Warranty: 12 months

**❌ Bad:**
- Maybe ₹4000? May or may not be in stock. Delivery might be fast.

### 3. 🔗 Add Stable Links
If you want your bot to share URLs with users:
- Add the actual link into your uploaded content (PDF or text).
- Make sure the link is live, accurate, and stable (won’t change or break).

**✅ Example:**  
“For our return policy, visit: https://yourstore.com/returns”



### 4. 🧪 Use the Right AI Engine (Optional)
Chatzy supports popular AI models like GPT-4, GPT-4o mini, and Gemini — depending on your account setup and configuration. You can choose the one that best fits your accuracy and latency needs.  
**Note:** Chatzy does not currently suggest AI models by use case.
