You can create and manage multiple teams inside Chatzy — perfect for agencies, departments, or client-specific projects.

👉 **How to Create a Team**
1. Go to the top menu and click on the “Select Team” dropdown.
2. Click on “Create New Team”.
3. Fill in:
   - **Team Name:** This will be used as the display name.
   - **Team URL:** This is the unique link slug for your team (e.g. `chatzy.ai/yourteam`).  
     ⚠ The Team URL must be unique and cannot match any existing team.

Once created, you’ll land on your new team dashboard where you can start setting up your AI agents.
