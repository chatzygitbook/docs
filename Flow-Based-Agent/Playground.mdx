🔍 What You Can Do:
- Simulate real user interactions
- Validate if the flow and transitions work correctly
- Spot errors or missing logic
- Check if Smart AI Mode triggers at the right time

🛠 Correction Loop:

If something breaks or doesn’t respond as expected, you can immediately return to the Studio and fix the node or logic. This ensures a smooth testing and debugging experience.
The Playground is a critical tool before publishing your bot, ensuring every interaction works seamlessly.
