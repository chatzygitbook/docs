Flow-based bots can be upgraded with Smart AI Mode to handle unexpected queries or responses.

✨ What Smart AI Mode Does:

- Makes the bot conversational
- Searches the Knowledge Base (KB)
- Updates variables based on user input
- Redirects the user back to the flow

**Example:** Expected a plan selection, user asks “What services do you offer?” → Smart AI fetches info from KB, answers, then returns to the pricing flow.
