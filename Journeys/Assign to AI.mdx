### ✅ Pre-Requisites

Before starting, make sure:
1. You have **connected channels** (WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger)
2. You've already created at least **one AI Agent**
    * Can be flow-based or conversational AI
    
***

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Create a New Journey

* Go to "**Journeys**" in the left menu
* Click "**Create Journey**"
* Name it something like "**Assign to AI Agent**"
* Start from a **blank template** (recommended for learning)

Click "**Create**" to enter the Journey Studio.

***

#### 2. Set the Trigger

Click "**Add Trigger**"
Select "**Conversation**"

On the right-side settings panel:
* Choose your **channel** (WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger)

**Event Options:**

| Option                 | What it does                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Conversation Created** | Triggers **every time** a new conversation starts            |
| **First Conversation Created** | Triggers **only once** for each contact, ever                |
| **Conversation Resumed** | *(Skip for now)* |

**Use Case Example:**
You're running a Click-to-WhatsApp ad → Choose "**Conversation Created**" to start AI response each time a user contacts you.

***

#### 3. Add Conditions (Optional but Powerful)

You can fine-tune when this journey should run:

✅ **Condition 1: Conversation Created in Response to a Template Message**  
- Triggers when a conversation starts as a reply to a specific template message.  
- Lets you assign different AI agents based on which template was replied to.  
- Useful for lead nurture or multi-campaign setups.  

**Example:**  
- Reply to Day 1 template → Assign to AI Agent A  
- Reply to Day 3 template → Assign to AI Agent B  
- Set time window: e.g., within 24 hours  

---

✅ **Condition 2: Conversation Created Excluding Response to a Template Message**  
- Triggers when a conversation is created **without** being a reply to any template message.  
- Useful for handling inbound messages that are not part of a template-driven campaign.  

**Example:**  
- Customer messages directly without replying to a template → Assign to General Inquiry Bot  

---

✅ **Condition 3: Conversation Created with Keyword**  
- Triggers when a conversation is created and contains a specified keyword.  
- Allows you to create separate journeys for each keyword.  

**Example:**  
- Customer replies with **"Book Appointment"** → Assign to Appointment Bot  
- Customer replies with **"Tell Me More"** → Assign to Info Bot  

---

✅ **Condition 4: Conversation Created Excluding Keywords**  
- Handles all conversations that do **not** contain certain keywords already handled by previous journeys.  

**Example:**  
- Journey A: Only if keyword is **"Pricing"**  
- Journey B: Excludes **"Pricing"** → Handles all other cases  

This ensures full coverage of all inbound messages.  

***

### 💡 What If You Use No Conditions?

Then this journey runs on **every conversation**, no matter the keyword or template.

> Useful for general inbound inquiries like "Hi," "Hello," etc.

***

### 4. Add the Action: Assign to AI Agent

Click the **plus (+) icon** → Choose "**Assign to AI Agent**"

In the settings panel:
