* Conversations are sorted by **latest activity**
* **Unread chats** show a blue tick
* Use the "**Unread**" filter to only see new/unanswered chats
* **Green dot** indicates:
    * AI is handling it
    * Human agent is live
    * Or it's in an automation flow

You can always take over by clicking "**Close Conversation**" (stops AI or flows and hands control to you).
