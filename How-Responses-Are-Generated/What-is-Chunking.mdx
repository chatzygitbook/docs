**Chunking** means splitting a document into smaller sections (chunks) that the AI can process.

**Why it matters:**
When a user asks a question like:

> “How many working days in a week?”

Here’s what Chatzy does:

1. Searches all stored chunks.

2. Picks the 3 most relevant ones.

3. Passes them to the AI model for a response.

Only those chunks are used — **not the whole document.**
