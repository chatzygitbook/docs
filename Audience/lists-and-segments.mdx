This area helps you group contacts — either **manually (Lists)** or **dynamically (Segments)** — for campaigns, personalization, or analytics.

### 📋 Lists (Manual Contact Groups)

* Create named lists with optional descriptions
* Add contacts manually or from imports
* Export lists as CSV
* Track when lists were created or last modified

**🎯 Best For:** Static groups like "Webinar Registrants" or "VIP Customers"

---

### ⚙️ Segments (Dynamic/Flow-Based Groups)

* Create segment names and descriptions
* Define filter conditions (if supported)
    > E.g. "Users from India who signed up in the last 7 days"
* View or export all segment members
* Auto-updates as user data changes

**🎯 Best For:** Real-time grouping based on behavior, location, signup source, etc.
