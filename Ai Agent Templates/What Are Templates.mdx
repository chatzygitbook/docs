Templates are **pre-configured AI Agent setups** designed for specific industries and use cases. They are **plug-and-play**, meaning you can get started quickly with minimal customization.

âœ… **What Do You Need to Change?**  

When using a template, you only need to update a few key fields:  
- **Company Name**  
- **AI Agent Name**  
- **Location**  
- **Contact Info**  
- **Brand voice or tone** (optional)  

The rest of the logic, conversation flow, and behavior come pre-built and ready to use.
